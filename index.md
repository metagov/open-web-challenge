# Challenge areas
To help you scope out your projects, we've identified a range of challenge areas motivated by NEAR's own governance problems.

* **Re-imagine the NEAR Community Fund.** [NEAR’s Community Fund](https://gov.near.org/t/community-fund-i-wiki/139) is a 5M $NEAR / 1.5M USD fund that supports DAOs, councils, and communities building on NEAR; it’s also the main entity funding this hackathon. It’s currently run by a council of ~7 people using simple up/down voting on Discourse proposals. In this challenge area, teams will propose improvements and/or completely new mechanisms for making distributions from the Community Fund. We’re especially interested in proposals that can make the process more decentralized and more participatory.
* **Govern the Rainbow Bridge.** The [Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/blog/the-rainbow-bridge-is-live/) is a new relay between Ethereum and NEAR, but we need to incentivize people to operate it. In this challenge, area you will submit a socio-technical design for a new Rainbow DAO to govern the Rainbow Bridge, incentivize contributions, and protect its future. Feel free to adapt the existing proposal, which you can find [here (see “Incentives”)](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/).
* **Better DAO frameworks on NEAR.** You’ve probably heard about [Sputnik DAOs](https://gov.near.org/t/launching-sputnik-daos/451) by now—but as far as DAO frameworks go, Sputnik is still pretty basic. In this challenge area, teams will spec and build out a new feature for Sputnik DAO. Alternately, they might port over an existing DAO framework such as Aragon or Colony (perhaps over the Rainbow Bridge, see above) or even invent their own DAO framework on NEAR. Do whatever you like, as long as it helps people build new and better DAOs.
* **Build a NEAR <> Discourse bridge.** Use [Metagov](https://docs.metagov.org/en/latest/index.html) and [PolicyKit](https://policykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create a governance policy on a social service such as Discourse that is “triggered” by an on-chain transaction. The Metagov prototype has a rudimentary NEAR plugin that can make NEAR function calls from policies, but it does not have a “listener” for reacting to on-chain events.
* **Experiment with DAO-to-DAO interactions.** There’s a lot of excitement right now in building DAO-to-DAO interactions. Just take a look at [recent research](https://medium.com/primedao/conceptual-models-for-dao2dao-relations-ac2b2d3cc84d) produced by the PrimeDAO / Curve Labs / Block Science team. In this challenge area, hackathon team will propose and build some new DAO-to-DAO contracts, e.g. a contract that NEAR’s Community DAO can use to fund a Metagov DAO to organize a hackathon, or a contract that transfers an Aragon DAO on Ethereum into a Sputnik DAO on NEAR, or a contract that sets up a cross-platform, cross-platform DAO (kind of like a multinational corporation). We’re hoping to see some really creative entries in this category!
* **Propose your own challenge.** This is our take on the “other” option. Maybe you have a good idea that doesn’t fit into any of the challenge areas above. So submit your own governance challenge to Metagov. If it’s accepted, you’ll get $100 just for writing the challenge, $1000 if you complete it, and $500 if ANYONE completes the challenge.

# Prizes
The winner and runner-up of each challenge area described will be awarded $1,200 and $800, respectively. The $5,000 top prize will be awarded to the overall winner of the governance challenge. And watch for additional bounties that will be announced closer to the start of the hackathon!

# Starter week
This hackathon is a bit special: we're running it *entirely through DAOs*. That means you'll need to register through a DAO and that the vast majority of hackathon prizes will be awarded through a DAO on NEAR to a DAO that you create. To make that prospect sweeter, we're encouraging people to get onboard early with $5,000 in prizes to be distributed in the first week. To qualify for a 30 NEAR payout (~ $120 USD), all you have to do is register a Sputnik DAO for your project, have a council with your team as voting members, and submit a 500-word draft proposal to the Metagov DAO *within the first week of the hackathon*. In addition to the direct payout, a submission will also qualify you for a round of special prizes.

New to DAOs? Take a look at [this excellent, up-to-date review](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) of the DAO phenomenon.

# Judging criteria
Challenge entries must consist of a proposal, a slide presentation, and a GitHub repo with code (where relevant). Entries will be judged on four criteria:

* **Impactful**: does the project solve a specific problem, generate meaningful information, or benefit a wide section of the open web ecosystem?
* **Creative**: how is the project different (and better) from previous alternatives? Be audacious.
* **Realistic**: is the project do-able, whether commercially, technologically, or politically? We know things can be complicated. But tell us how you plan on overcoming the obstacles.
* **Collaborative**: does the project interact with other projects, NEAR Councils, or DAOs? Engage with the ecosystem. Do your research, and tap into what other makers have already built. 

We want to emphasize something: *entries do not have to be technical*. We encourage a mix of technical and social innovation---remember, blockchain itself is, at its core, a social innovation as well as a technical one!

# Introducing the new tools of governance
We have a ton of special governance workshops, events, and opportunities for you to train and build skills for the hackathon. We're also curating access to a range of tools that might help you expand your experiments.

1. [Sputnik DAO](https://sputnik.fund/): NEAR's premier DAO technology, Sputnik DAOs offer an easy, accessible platform for collective decision-making on the blockchain
2. [Metagov](http://docs.metagov.org/): a unified API gateway that helps developers access and hook up a bunch of governance services & platforms
3. [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io): SourceCred is a reputation algorithm helps communities measure and reward value creation
4. [PolicyKit](https://www.policykit.org): PolicyKit is a framework for authoring governance procedures and policies directly on top of social platforms

# Legal disclaimer
We may add changes and clarifications to the rules above. When changes occur, we'll let you know by email.

# Towards better governance
The Open Web Governance Challenge is part of a governance research initiative led by the [Metagovernance Project](metagov.org) and [NEAR](near.org).
