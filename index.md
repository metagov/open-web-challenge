# Challenge areas and bounties
To help you scope out your projects, we've identified a range of governance challenges motivated by the real issues faced by Web3 communities. Challenge areas in **bold** are funded, meaning that you can earn additional bounties (whether or not you win a prize above) for submitting a proposal that answers that challenge. The winner and runner-up of each funded challenge area described will be awarded $1,000 and $500, respectively. In the meantime, watch for additional bounties that will be announced closer to the start of the hackathon!

* **Re-imagine the NEAR Community Fund.** [NEAR’s Community Fund](https://gov.near.org/t/community-fund-i-wiki/139) is a 5M $NEAR / 1.5M USD fund that supports DAOs, councils, and communities building on NEAR; it’s also the main entity funding this hackathon. It’s currently run by a council of ~7 people using simple up/down voting on Discourse proposals. In this challenge area, teams will propose improvements and/or completely new mechanisms for making distributions from the Community Fund. We’re especially interested in proposals that can make the process more decentralized and more participatory.
* **Govern the Rainbow Bridge.** The [Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/blog/the-rainbow-bridge-is-live/) is a new relay between Ethereum and NEAR, but we need to incentivize people to operate it. In this challenge, area you will submit a socio-technical design for a new Rainbow DAO to govern the Rainbow Bridge, incentivize contributions, and protect its future. Feel free to adapt the existing proposal, which you can find [here (see “Incentives”)](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/).
* **Better DAO frameworks on NEAR.** You’ve probably heard about [Sputnik DAOs](https://gov.near.org/t/launching-sputnik-daos/451) by now—but as far as DAO frameworks go, Sputnik is still pretty basic. In this challenge area, teams will spec and build out a new feature for Sputnik DAO. Alternately, they might port over an existing DAO framework such as Aragon or Colony (perhaps over the Rainbow Bridge, see above) or even invent their own DAO framework on NEAR. Do whatever you like, as long as it helps people build new and better DAOs.
* **Develop the NEAR Metagov Plugin**. The Metagov Prototype has a rudimentary [NEAR plugin](https://github.com/metagov/metagov-prototype/tree/master/metagov/metagov/plugins/near) that can make _view_ and _call_ RPC function calls to a single NEAR contract. For this challenge, you will extend the NEAR Plugin to make it more useful. We'd be really excited to see someone implement a [listener](https://docs.metagov.org/en/latest/plugin_tutorial.html#listener) for reacting to on-chain transactions. This may require building or running a NEAR Indexer, or using an existing tool like [Figment's NEAR Indexer REST API](https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/near/enriched-apis/indexer-api). This would support governance policies that are "triggered" by on-chain transactions. For example, supporting a PolicyKit policy like: "when my community passes a proposal in our SputnikDAO, reward the proposer by granting them a specific Discourse badge on our community forum." Other improvements to the NEAR Plugin (or new NEAR- or SputnikDAO-specific plugins) will be considered for this bounty as well. Some possible areas of improvement are around security, accounts, and implementing a [Metagov governance process](https://docs.metagov.org/en/latest/plugin_tutorial.html#governance-processes) backed by NEAR.
* **Experiment with PolicyKit and the Metagov Prototype.** In this challenge area, teams will propose PolicyKit policies that address governance problems for communities that exist on 2 or more governance platforms (DAOs, Discourse community forums, SourceCred instances, Open Collective collectives, and so on). Take a look at the [PolicyKit Policy Library](https://policykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_policies.html) for examples of policies that use Metagov. We’re hoping to see some creative proposals that address real-world governance problems – it’s okay if they aren’t technically possible with the current PolicyKit and Metagov features and plugins.
* **Experiment with DAO-to-DAO interactions.** There’s a lot of excitement right now in building DAO-to-DAO interactions. Just take a look at [recent research](https://medium.com/primedao/conceptual-models-for-dao2dao-relations-ac2b2d3cc84d) produced by the PrimeDAO / Curve Labs / Block Science team. In this challenge area, hackathon team will propose and build some new DAO-to-DAO contracts, e.g. a contract that NEAR’s Community DAO can use to fund a Metagov DAO to organize a hackathon, or a contract that transfers an Aragon DAO on Ethereum into a Sputnik DAO on NEAR, or a contract that sets up a cross-platform, cross-platform DAO (kind of like a multinational corporation). We’re hoping to see some really creative entries in this category!
* _Make Web3 billing more secure and more convenient for contractors._ The Web3 space is still in its infancy, particularly in terms of methods and best practices. This makes estimating design and development work nearly impossible. More often than not requirements and methods are being developed as products and primitives are created and tested.  However, the predominant means of funding for work in DAOs and blockchains is a grant-based system where funds are unlocked in lump sums based on proposals approved by the community. This creates a risk vector for contractors, particularly if the billed amount surpasses the unlocked funds. The contractor at this point is faced with a choice between stopping work while waiting for additional funds to be unlocked, possibly suffering a loss in reputation and/or subsequent work with said community, or continuing work with the potential risk of not having the community sanction additional funds to cover extra work. To ensure rapid growth within the DAO space and to attract more competent contractors there needs to be a method for allowing continuous funding for project within the DAO framework.

* _Build a tool to track "decisons" and "insights" directly on top of Telegram or Matrix._ For the last 9 months, members of the [DADA](http://dada.art/) art community have been collectively creating a new socio-economic system for the arts called [The Invisible Economy](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-basic-income-9e2112f9b97d). Our governance process consists of continuous collective deliberation through sense-making sessions that take place on Google Meet, complemented with a Telegram chat. We don’t need a voting mechanism to make decisions. We need better, unified tools for deliberation that would make it easier to record decision making, organize ideas and insights, and weave a rhizomatic narrative without disrupting the natural flow of the conversations. A better tool for deliberation would: (1) Be able to open a decision, track its deliberation and record the result. (2) Easily search and find open decisions and closed decisions and their results. (3) Include a simple way to highlight an idea, insight, or reference. (4) Create a narrative of insights / ideas across channels. (4) Mirror as much as possible the natural flow of human conversation so that topics are more easily tracked and followed. For more, see [DADA's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKdUMLBFyG4) on the idea. Challenge courtesy of [DADA](http://dada.art/).
* _Draw significant insights from a governance data set._ For all you data scientists out there, we're not leaving you in the lurch. Do you have a data set you've been working work that you think could change how people govern themselves? Are you interested in looking at some existing data sets and making a guess . Governance is all about making decisions, and helps us make *informed* decisions. To help you out, we've organized some existing governance data sets that you can take a look at. See below.
* **Propose your own challenge.** Are you facing a problem but don't know what the solution should be (or how to build it)? If so, consider submitting your own governance challenge to Metagov. If your challenge is accepted, your challenge will go on the list above, and you’ll get 20 NEAR just for writing the challenge and 100 NEAR if ANYONE (including yourself) answers the challenge. See [below](#propose-your-own-challenge) for more details.

# Starter week
This hackathon is a bit special: we're running it *entirely through DAOs*. That means you'll need to register through a DAO and that the vast majority of hackathon prizes will be awarded through a DAO on NEAR to a DAO that you create. To make that prospect sweeter, we're encouraging people to get onboard early with $5,000 in prizes to be distributed in the first week. To qualify for a 30 NEAR payout (~ $120 USD), all you have to do is register a [Sputnik DAO](https://sputnik.fund/) for your project, have a council with your team as voting members, and submit a 500-word draft proposal to the [Metagov DAO](https://www.sputnik.fund/dao/metagov.sputnikdao.near/proposals) *within the first week of the hackathon*. If you already ahve a Sputnik DAO, that works too. Remember to have set the payout target for your proposal to your Sputnik DAO, NOT your personal NEAR wallet! In addition to the direct payout, a submission will also qualify you for a round of special prizes. Note that there's a finite prize pool for payouts, so proposals will be answered first-come-first-serve.

New to DAOs? Take a look at [this excellent, up-to-date review](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos) of the DAO phenomenon.

# Propose your own challenge
Are you facing a problem but don't know what the solution should be (or how to build it)? If so, consider submitting your own governance challenge to Metagov. Challenges must (1) be relevant to the governance of blockchains, DAOs, and other online communities, (2) expose a concrete problem or opportunity, (3) not duplicate existing challenges, and (4) be clear and accessible to other hackers (and not just yourself). The description of your challenge should come with a "hook" of ~100 words (use the challenge areas above as examples) and be between 500-1000 words. If your challenge is accepted, your challenge will go on the list above, and you’ll get 20 NEAR just for writing the challenge and 100 NEAR if ANYONE (including yourself) answers the challenge. 

Note that "propose your own challenge" proposals _do not_ count as project proposals for the sake of "starter week" payouts (see above).

If you want to take this option, write a Discourse post describing the challenge (follow the [how to enter a submission](#how-to-enter-a-submission) section below) and submit a payout proposal to the [Metagov DAO](https://www.sputnik.fund/dao/metagov.sputnikdao.near/proposals) *within the first week of the challenge* (May 22nd). Note that there’s a finite prize pool for "propose your own" payouts, so proposals will be answered first-come-first-serve. The challenge organizers reserve the right to decide whether a project sufficiently answers your challenge.

# Introducing the new tools of governance
We have a ton of special governance workshops, events, and opportunities for you to train and build skills for the hackathon. We're also curating access to a range of tools that might help you expand your experiments.

1. [Sputnik DAO](https://sputnik.fund/): NEAR's premier DAO technology, Sputnik DAOs offer an easy, accessible platform for collective decision-making on the blockchain
2. [Metagov Prototype](http://docs.metagov.org/): a unified API gateway that helps developers access and hook up several governance services & platforms. Metagov currently has plugins for connecting to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/), [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io), [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), and [NEAR](https://docs.near.org/). Metagov is in the early prototype phase; contributions and feedback are welcome! The Metagov Prototype API can be used directly by a backend service or script, or it can be accessed through PolicyKit.
3. [PolicyKit](https://www.policykit.org): PolicyKit is a framework for authoring governance procedures and policies directly on top of social platforms. It has direct integrations with Slack, Discourse, Discord, and Reddit. It is also integrated with Metagov, enabling governance policies to invoke any governance services or platforms that are made available through the [Metagov Prototype API](https://prototype.metagov.org/redoc/).
4. [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io): SourceCred is a reputation algorithm helps communities measure and reward value creation.

#### Using Metagov Prototype & PolicyKit

If you're using PolicyKit and/or the Metagov Prototype for the governance challenge, we recommend running your own instances of each. That will require setting up a new server, [installing Metagov](https://docs.metagov.org/en/latest/installation.html), and [installing PolicyKit](https://policykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html).

There is also a hosted version of PolicyKit at [gov-challenge-policykit.metagov.org/main](https://gov-challenge-policykit.metagov.org/main) which you can use to play around with Metagov-enabled policy authoring without setting up your own server. You can install this PolicyKit instance to your Slack, Discord, or Discourse community. Once you're signed in to PolicyKit, go to the Settings page to enable Metagov plugins for your community. Once you have some plugins enabled, you can write policies that perform Metagov actions, Metagov processes, and/or are triggered by Metagov events. See the [Metagov Policy examples here](https://policykit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_policies.html#metagov-policies). See the [Metagov Prototype API docs](https://gov-challenge-metagov.metagov.org/redoc/) for specification of actions and processes.

Participants interested in using these tools are encouraged to attend the [Metagov & PolicyKit Workshop](https://createbase.community/event/metagov-policykit-workshop/) at 1pm ET on Saturday May 15th.

# Governance data sets
The data science of governance design is an emerging field, with the best examples representing written and software rules from online communities.

1. _NEAR's ecosystem_ has a number of relevant data sets, including [ecosystem stats](https://ecosystem-metrics.onrender.com), [more graphs](https://explorer.near.org/stats), and [NEAR's weekly analytics updates](https://gov.near.org/t/key-ecosystem-metrics-and-analytics-weekly-updates-apr-26/1430)
2. _Snapshot_ is a common polling service in blockchain. Check out [their API](https://docs.snapshot.org/snapshot-hub-api/hub-api).
1. _Govbase's DAOs in the Wild_ is a table of DAOs and how they are governed. [Govbase](https://thelastjosh.medium.com/introducing-govbase-97884b0ddaef) itself is a comprehensive data set of software projects and organizations in online governance. [Data](https://airtable.com/shrIxJgYLurzJ3xYC)
2. _The MakerDAO governance subgraph_ includes all the data on voters and votes for MakerDAO. [Data](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/protofire/makerdao-governance)
3. _The Cryptovernance Governance Assessments_ include a range of qualitative survey responses to a comprehensive governance questionnaire. [Data](https://cryptogov.net/participating-projects/)
4. _BoardRoom_ tracks a number of governance proposal processes across different blockchain projects. [Service](https://app.boardroom.info/)
5. _DeepDAO_ has tracked key indicators for a range of major DAOs. [Data](https://deepdao.io/)
6. _Fiesler et al._ classify the written rules of Reddit subreddits according to their type and subject. One project might try to improve upon their classifier with more recent NLP techniques. [Paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15033). [Data](https://0w.uk/rg4bb)
7. _Chandrasekharan et al._ look at the actual use of such rules, with data on Reddit user comments that were removed by sub moderators. A feature of this dataset is that many of these flagged comments are annotated with the text of the rule that was violated. One project might build a predictor of which rules will be flagged, and on what grounds. This is the largest and best annotated and documented of the datasets. [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3274301). [Data](https://github.com/ceshwar/reddit-norm-violations)
8. _Frey and Sumner_ look at a different domain, self-hosted Minecraft servers, to compare the governance plugins that amateur administrators install with the success that they achieved at building a core group of returning users. It gives a unique perspective into the "folk theory" of governance design: what governance structures people use when they don't know better. One project might replicate and then creatively extend the paper's findings. [Paper](http://doi.org/c76k). [Data](https://doi.org/gccz)

# Judging criteria
Challenge entries must consist of a submission post, a slide presentation, and a GitHub repo with code (where relevant). Entries will be judged on four criteria:

* **Impactful**: does the project solve a specific problem, generate meaningful information, or benefit a wide section of the open web ecosystem?
* **Creative**: how is the project different (and better) from previous alternatives? Be audacious.
* **Realistic**: is the project do-able, whether commercially, technologically, or politically? We know things can be complicated. But tell us how you plan on overcoming the obstacles.
* **Collaborative**: does the project interact with other projects, NEAR Councils, or DAOs? Engage with the ecosystem. Do your research, and tap into what other makers have already built. 

We want to emphasize something: *entries do not have to be technical*. We encourage a mix of technical and social innovation---remember, blockchain itself is, at its core, a social innovation as well as a technical one!

# How to enter a submission
_Due: 5pm EST on Saturday, June 5th_

Post your submission to the [Governance Category](https://gov.near.org/c/gov/6/l/latest) of the NEAR Forum with tag "metagov". Please use [this template](https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-example-project-proposal/1578) to structure your post. (Note, if you are open to adding additional collaborators, please add the "looking-for-group" tag to your proposal.)

Add a new payout proposal for 0 NEAR to the [Metagov SputnikDAO](https://www.sputnik.fund/dao/metagov.sputnikdao.near/proposals). The payout target should be your team's DAO. Include a link to your forum post. Judges will use the link provided to make a voting decision on your submission. The proposal should be for zero NEAR because the payout amount will vary depending on what you win.

Please only use only one forum thread per submission. Posts to the forum can be edited or replied to if you need to add content to a submission.
